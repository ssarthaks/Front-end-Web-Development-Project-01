        <h3 class="bodyheading1"><i>BONSAI PLANTS</i></h3>
        <p class="bodyparagraph1">The word “Bon-sai” (often misspelled as bonzai or banzai) is a Japanese term which,
            literally translated, means “planted in a container”.
            This art form is derived from an ancient Chinese horticultural practice,
            part of which was then redeveloped under the influence of Japanese Zen Buddhism.It has been around for well
            over a thousand years. The ultimate goal of growing a Bonsai is to create a miniaturized but
            realistic representation of nature in the form of a tree. Bonsai are not genetically dwarfed
            plants, in fact, any tree species can be used to grow one.
        </p>
        <h3 class="bodyheading1"><i>What Do You Exactly Mean By Bonsai Plants?</i></h3>
        <p class="bodyparagraph1">Techniques such as pinching buds, pruning and wiring branches, and carefully
            restricting
            but not abandoning fertilizers are used to limit and redirect healthy growth. Most commonly
            kept under four feet (or about a meter) in height, Bonsai are not genetically dwarfed plants.
            However, plants with smaller leaves do make these compositions easier to design. In fact, any
            plant species that has a woody stem or trunk, grows true branches, can be successfully grown in a
            container to restrict its roots/food storage capability, and has smaller or reducible-leaves can be
            used to create a Bonsai.Look around at your trees, bushes, hedges, the copses in your yard or park, plants
            in the nursery or wild landscape - essentially any of those can be starter material. Carefully collected
            during
            the appropriate growing or dormant season with proper permission, your composition is begun. Most native
            plants
            can be grown outdoors; material from more tropical climates needs at least some protection from the elements
            in
            the temperate zones.
