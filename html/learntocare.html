        <h1 style="color:white;text-align:center;"><i>How to grow a Bonsai Plant ?</i></h1>
        <p>
            You can grow a bonsai from seeds, though that will take three to five years before it
            produces leaves. You can also purchase certain bonsai varieties from a garden center or
            specialty store.<b> Follow these instructions to ensure your bonsai thrives:</b>
        </p>

        <h3>1) Repot your bonsai tree to ensure growth</h3>
        <p>
            When you purchase a new bonsai, carefully remove the tree from the current pot, clear the
            dirt away from the root mass, and prune any root tips that curve upwards or any overly large
            roots. Pruning the roots will ensure that the bonsai doesn't outgrow its new container. The
            remaining roots should be slender and long and close to the surface of the soil. Do not remove
            more than 25 percent of the roots.
        </p>

        <h3>2) Cover the bonsai in soil</h3>
        <p>
            Generally, a bonsai grows best in specialized bonsai potting soil—a mixture of akadama
            (a type of clay), pumice, lava rock, compost, and fine gravel/grit that provides aeration
            and nutrients. Make sure the bonsai pot has drainage holes.
        </p>

        <h3>3) Place your bonsai tree in direct sunligh</h3>
        <p>
            Bonsai trees need at least six hours of direct sunlight a day—though some varieties will
            require more light or more shade, so check the particular care instructions. Place the bonsai
            plant on a window sill where it will get plenty of direct sunlight.
        </p>

        <h3>4) Water the bonsai tree every few days</h3>
        <p>
            Water the bonsai thoroughly so the excess water drains through the potholes and the root
            system is thoroughly soaked. Water the bonsai when the soil is slightly dry or completely dry,
            every one to three days. Overwatering can lead to root rot.

        <h1 style="color:white;text-align:center;"><i>5 Care Tips for Bonsai Plants</i></h1>
        <h3>1) Fertilize the bonsai tree during its growing season</h3>
        <p>
            Every bonsai will have particular care instructions depending on the type of tree.
            <b>Follow these general bonsai care instructions so your plant will thrive in an indoor
                environment year-round:</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Because a bonsai tree is pot-bound, it will quickly deplete the soil's nutrients and
            need frequent fertilization. Fertilize with a specialized bonsai fertilizer every week or
            two during its growing season from early spring to fall. In the winter, decrease the
            fertilizer to once a month. A yellowing bonsai can signify a lack of nutrients.
        </p>
        <h3>2) Give your bonsai tree humidity</h3>
        <p>
            Many trees cultivated for bonsai are tropical and subtropical breeds, so they require ample moisture. Place
            the
            bonsai next to a humidifier or mist it with a spray bottle throughout the day. You can also lay the bonsai
            on a
            humidity tray. Fill a tray with decorative pebbles and pour water onto the pebbles—as the water evaporates,
            it will
            provide humidity to the plant. Ensure the water does not touch the bottom of the pot, or else it will make
            the soil
            too soggy.
        </p>
        <h3>3) Prune the tree from early spring to fall</h3>
        <p>
            During growing season, prune the branches and leaves to keep the tree compact and encourage new growth. Put
            a
            healing paste on the cut area of pruned branches to prevent disease.
        </p>
        <h3>4) Shape your bonsai tree with wiring</h3>
        <p>
            Use aluminum and copper wire to shape and curve the tree's branches to keep it compact. When the plant is
            dormant in the winter, wrap the stems with the wire and bend them to the shape in which you want them to
            grow.
            After the branches grow in the desired direction, carefully remove the wire so as not to scar the plant.
        </p>
        <h3>5) Repot the bonsai plant every few years</h3>
        <p>
            Repot bonsai trees in a new pot that's at least one inch wider, give the plant fresh soil, and prune
            the root ball. The frequency of repotting depends on the tree species. Repot young, fast-growing bonsai
            trees
            every year or two, and mature bonsai trees every three to five years.
