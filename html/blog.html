        <!-- Writing The Description on Blog page -->
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Technology is around us everywhere, from simple devices like our smartphones, laptop, and TV to background
            tech that we don't even notice. It isn't going anywhere anytime soon, meaning we have to get accustomed to
            it. Once we get the hang of using tech the right way, it can improve our lives.
            On the other hand, tech can also make our lives harder. Whether tech has a positive or negative effect on
            our lives, it all depends on how we use it. So, let's look at some of the positive and negative aspects of
            technology in our lives, shall we?
        </p>
        <p>
            Many new tech advancements and innovations are made by and for businesses. Why? Because companies are always
            looking to upgrade their products and services for profit.New technology continues to come out faster than
            we can keep up with. The purpose is to boost business andmake the daily management of enterprises more
            systematic, structured, and successful.
            Tech has boosted businesses by improving the hiring process, error-free collection and analysis of business
            data, and better communication with clients and partners.
        </p>
        <p>
            Advancements in tech have made it easier for more people to access the internet, resulting in online
            shopping being more popular now than ever. Currently, most people prefer to shop online without leaving the
            house because of its sheer convenience. Instead of wasting hours in the shopping mall, tech makes shopping
            simple. A few of the benefits of online shopping include cheaper products, saved time, fuel, and energy,
            easier-to-find items, a wider variety online, and no added pressure.
        </p>

        <h1>Advantages</h1>
        <h3>1. Communication Is More Convenient</h3>
        <p>
            Nowadays, there are various means available for everyone to communicate with each other. People can quickly
            gain access to a mobile phone or a computer, and connect with anyone with the use of the Internet and social
            media.<br>
            The advancements in technology helped pave the way for a faster and easier way to communicate. In the past,
            exchanging information takes days, sometimes even weeks, since the only way to reach someone distant is
            through letters or greeting cards. But, now, you can send someone an e-mail in a matter of seconds.

        <h3>2. The Healthcare Industry Became More Efficient</h3>
        <p>

            Another significant benefit of technology in people's lives is the modernization of the healthcare industry.
            Gone are the days of long lines in the outpatient ward and hours of waiting for a doctor's consultation.
            Patients can schedule a hospital visit using their mobile phones and check if their doctor's office is open.
            This way, they don't need to waste their time going to a hospital only to be informed that a doctor can't
            see them.<br>
            Hospital procedures are also faster and more efficient, thanks to technology. For instance, healthcare
            document scanners are now used by many medical facilities to digitize old medical files for easier access.
            By moving printed documents to a digital system, any healthcare staff can conveniently access a patient's
            record with a computer. It also lessens the risk of misplacing or losing a patient's records since all
            information will be stored safely on a web application.
        </p>
        <h3> 3. Access To Information Is Easier</h3>
        <p>
            Before the digital age, searching for specific information means spending hours looking through printed
            sources, like books, newspapers, and magazines. But, now, all you need is a phone and access to the Internet
            to find what you need.<br>
            Thousands of resources are available on various online platforms, making it convenient for someone to search
            for the information they need. For instance, technological tools help people access details about their
            health conditions, which aren't too serious to require medical attention. You can take care of simple health
            concerns, like allergies or a cold, since you can search for natural remedies or preventive measures you can
            do at home.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Advancements In Medicine</h3>
        <p>
            Thanks to technology, treatments that seemed too far-fetched are now possible. It's not unusual for
            hospitals to perform complex treatments, such as organ transplants or chemotherapy, to cure patients
            suffering from serious illnesses.<br>
            Patients who are battling severe health conditions have a higher chance of surviving today, thanks to the
            vast contributions of technology to the field of medicine. Various medical research and development efforts
            have also been done to find treatments for serious diseases that seemed incurable before technological
            advancements.
        </p>

        <h3> 5. Better Opportunities For Learning</h3>

        <!-- Adding images for better looking website -->

        <img src="../images/plants/BonsaiTree6.png" title="Bonsai Tree" class="blogimgfloatright">

        <p>
            Classroom learning is now made more interactive and engaging to keep students interested. Teachers use
            technology to plan activities and create learning materials that may help students pay attention in class.
            Technological tools and online applications have also made e-learning or remote learning possible. People
            who wish to get a degree can now do so in the comfort of their own homes. The integration of technological
            tools in learning gives students more flexibility and access to education that weren't available before the
            digital age.<br>
            Now, students can access lessons online and find other resources, such as videos or research papers, to
            better cope with their studies.
        </p>

        <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
        <h3>1. Technology Causes Health Problems</h3>
        <p>
            As technology advances, we are connected now more than ever, and it has become a huge part of our lives.
            That's why it's possible for technology to impact our physical health negatively.
            These physical health problems can be severe. Nevertheless, you can avoid most of them by creating healthy
            tech habits instead of bad ones.<br>
            Apart from creating unhealthy sleeping patterns, electronic devices can cause digital eye strain, poor
            posture, and increased inactivity, leading to health problems like obesity.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Technology Creates Job Insecurity</h3>
        <p>
            Job loss and downsizing are two significant adverse effects of technology. Because of advances in the tech
            field such as AI integration, automating and accomplishing tasks have become easy.
            In this day and age, most companies need to stay up to date with the latest technology, but in the process,
            low-skilled employees, like factory workers and cashiers, will be replaced.<br>
            Machines can now carry out tasks that only humans could do so far, which creates a massive shortage of jobs.
            The bottom line is that people aren't necessarily needed for work tasks anymore because of how efficient
            tech has become.
        </p>
        <h3> 3. Tech Products Lack Longevity</h3>
        <p>
            Technology grows incredibly quickly, so the digital devices and gadgets that we use have a short lifespan
            and become outdated in a matter of months.<br>
            Since these devices are so important in our daily lives, we need to maintain and upgrade them regularly.
            Besides maintenance and upgrades, these pieces of tech may just become outdated.
        </p>

        <img src="../images/plants/BonsaiTree6.png" title="Bonsai Tree" class="blogimgfloatright">

        <h3>4. Technology Spawns Misinformation and Fake News</h3>
        <p>
            The spread of misinformation and fake news online is nothing new. In fact, it has been going on for many
            years. However, with all the developments that happen so frequently in technology, it has become harder to
            define what's true and what's not.<br>
            Since so many people cannot tell what information is factual and what isn't, it creates a lot of skepticism
            and misunderstanding about important topics. This can be especially harmful when it comes to political
            issues and trusting the media.<br>
            One recent example of how tech advancements are negatively affecting us is the use of deepfakes. Several
            negative deepfake incidents have surfaced recently, and it's getting harder and harder to spot them.
        </p>
        <h1>Impacts</h1>
        <p>
            Technology affects every area of our lives. The way we carry out our business and interact with others is
            influenced by technology. It has enhanced socialization and productivity, among other spheres that touch our
            daily lives.<br>
            The power of the internet has changed everything and made the entire globe a small village.There are many
            things that we can boast about when we talk of technology in the current century.<br>
            For example, technology has influenced education and the way we learn. There is more personalized learning,
            and students can get help from experts online. Currently, learners can get access to info readily and
            complete their tasks confidently. It is easier to handle assignments because they can scrutinize various
            services and find the best academic assistant platforms to aid them deliver premium pieces. It is a plus for
            most students who struggle to complete their assignments.<br>
            <br>
            In this coursework we developed a website through which people can shop plants from their home and also get
            the plants delivered. Same like this, many of us get our fashions online. We buy our clothes, gadgets,
            foodstuffs, and other comedies online. The array of online stores helps us to access various materials
            easily. Besides, there are countless cards and phone payment methods that have made online purchases
            convenient.<br>
            Right now, if you want to buy anything, you can check it online. You do not have to travel far. We make
            orders and have everything delivered at our doorsteps. This shows how technology is impacting our daily
            lives.<br>
            Technology is now at the center of commerce. People turn to technology when they want to get information
            about various products. They can also compare prices from different stores to make informed choices. This
            was a distant dream, but it is possible with the internet.<br>
